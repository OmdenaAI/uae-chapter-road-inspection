# Model Finetuning and Results:

*Goal:  Implementation of Binary Image Classification with CNNs using the Crack/Groove dataset and Rut/Subsidence dataset. 
*Classes :  Crack/Groove and Rut/Subsidence 
*Used a balanced dataset of 2250:2250 for Crack/Groove and Used a balanced dataset of 199:199 for Rut/Subsidence.  
*Test Data has a total of 450 samples for Crack/Groove with 225 for each class and a total of 40 samples for Rut/Subsidence with 20 for each class.
